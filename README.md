# Volume Hand Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains code and resources for a computer vision project that detects hand gestures to control volume using OpenCV.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a system that allows users to control the volume of a device using hand gestures in front of a camera. The application uses OpenCV for hand detection and recognition, enabling users to change the volume by making specific gestures.

## Features

- Hand detection using OpenCV.
- Gesture recognition for volume control.
- Integration with audio API for volume adjustments.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the application:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Audio API library (e.g., PyAudio)

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pyaudio
